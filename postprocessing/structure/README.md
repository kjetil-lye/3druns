# Computation of the structure functions

Since the 3D datasets typically are too large for in-situ computations, we
run this script to compute the structure functions after the simulation.

## Compilation

Compile with cmake, you need to have alsvinn compiled and installed


## Usage

Run

    ./compute_structure_function <path_to_nc_file> <path_to_output_file>
