3d runs single (Kelvinh-Helmholtz)
=====================
These are single sample runs for 3d Kelvin Helmholtz. The purpose of these
experiments were mostly to see the effect of the different perturbations of KH
in 3d.

There are two options

  * high and low perturbation
  * velocity in z direction or not (default is u_z=0)
